# SnowingOcean

Large eddy simulations of frazil ice advection, formation, and melting in the turbulent upper ocean

## Getting started

First [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and clone this repository. Next, navigate to this repository's directory and instantiate the environment by starting julia and then typing

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate()
```

## Freezing temperature and thermal expansion coefficient as a function of salinity and depth

This plot is generated by running `freezing_temperature.jl`:

Note that the freezing temperature of seawater decreases with depth. This means that frazil ice advected to depth will melt.
Moreover, the thermal expansion coefficient of seawater is positive for moderately saline waters at the freezing temperature.
This means that cooling due to latent heat fluxes during frazil ice melting at depth makes the ocean more dense.
